# BTP-BIQA

The files in this repository were used during the master thesis 'Explainable AI for Blind Image Quality Assessment'. 

##### Research findings

1.	Deep learning-based BIQA models are powerful, for the reason that they facilitate end-to-end-learning as well as content aware quality assessment. 

2.	In this exploratory project two decision trees were developed to assess technical image quality (subjective) as well as aesthetic image quality (highly subjective). Although the technical quality decision tree performs comparable to conventional BIQA methods, performance of both decision trees is lower than that of state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods. 

3.	By developing a web application, I have shown that the out-of-the-box characteristics of a decision tree are useful in making the algorithm transparent, explainable and adaptable.

4.	Survey results of users who interacted with the web application, hint at three conclusions:
*	Perceived model performance cannot be fully explained by its test set performance; 
*	Perceived performance is not the only characteristic influencing model preference;
*	Users prefer a model that is transparent, explainable and adaptable to their needs.
