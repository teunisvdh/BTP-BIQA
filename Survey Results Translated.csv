0,4,4,3,4,4,9,6,6,Model 1,"My ""best"" picture scores higher",4,5,
1,5,5,4,4,6,9,7,8,No preference,"In both models, I understand a part of the ranking scores very well, but sometimes not. I think one model slightly more accurate than model A, but the difference is small.",5,5,"An important caveat to AI is indeed transparency is often forgotten. A related phenomenon is that the user, who his / her choices on bases do not know the underlying inputs and tradeoffs are. Thus laziness (under the heading ""convenience and efficiency"") deficiency quickly and mismanagement. AI, even if the motor is correct, facilitates mindless eenheidsworsterij until we recognize its limitations."
2,3,5,5,5,8,8,7,6,Model A,"It's nice to get a brief explanation to because you are not familiar with the app. In addition, you can easily see how you can improve the picture",4,5,Success!
3,3,5,5,4,7,9,8,9,Model 1,This model gives sharper pictures a higher ranking (I think),5,4,
4,5,5,5,4,8,10,10,9,Model A,"Model 1 gives me do the right picture as No. 1, but the user experience of model A is better. It is very interesting to see where he scores well. This way you get yourself to new insights. It must be arranged as the pictures 1 and 2 have almost the same quality.",5,5,Teunis really cool. This is seriously very important in many decisions. Similarly in healthcare. Will you send a link to a podcast allows them frolic without great success. Gr. ...
5,3,5,4,4,4,7,7,6,Model 1,There were few differences was better ranked in the scores of A. Model 1 Model. (Curious about the algorithm). I was not entirely clear what the purpose of the rankings.,4,4,If you have specific questions. ... success!
6,3,5,5,4,5,5,8,8,Model 1,"view out the window without frame and curtain, at least at the top came.",1,3,"Transparency is a trained model, but limited. Here I had in both cases no transparantie.Daarom not important. Whether it is an important AI choice made to fit depends very afvan the kind of choice ... ;-)"
7,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,7,Model A,To adjust to,4,5,Super interesting! Does thinking about who decides what quality is.
8,5,5,5,5,9,9,8,6,Model A,issues important,5,4,
9,1,5,3,3,5,3,3,3,Model A,Otherwise it is a pure black box.,5,5,interface sucks big time. Way too brief.
10,5,5,5,4,6,6,7,6,Model 1,"Focus seems to me the most important, but sometimes a picture is the wrong focus. Which are wrongly top ,. Still prevails sharpness for me",1,5,"AI for image selection does not have to be transparent. If bad happens, I use it or not I switch to something else. Manual dialing reserving a proposal is essential in photography (soft focus, playing with depth of focus, etc.)"
11,1,5,5,3,6,9,9,9,Model 1,"Score is much higher for the best pictures, which was previously very close to each other and really bad pictures unclear scored lower",4,5,Only when you know why a score deviates from your expectation you can understand it. Risk is that what you want is not operated by K. I.
12,3,5,3,3,8,7,9,8,Model 1,Model 1 almost corresponded to own ranking. A model no.,5,5,No
13,5,5,5,4,7,8,8,8,Model 1,Is more suited to my taste. But there would be more time to take. Volatile done.,5,3,
14,5,5,4,4,6,7,8,8,Model 1,works finer,5,4,
15,3,4,4,4,8,6,6,6,Model A,I feel that model A select better quality photos,3,5,"Difficult to determine whether you assess the quality of the picture itself, or the content and the degree of ""fun"" of a photograph."
16,5,3,3,3,7,9,7,9,Model 1,,4,4,
17,3,5,5,5,8,8,7,6,Model A,"It's nice to get a brief explanation to because you are not familiar with the app. In addition, you can easily see how you can improve the picture",4,5,Success!
18,3,4,3,3,5,6,5,6,No preference,In both models is not my favorite picture at the top.,5,5,"In artificial intelligence, I soon made to feel out of control, which is unpleasant. It should be human activity on us a welcome addition."
19,4,4,1,3,7,7,9,7,No preference,"Model A provides more information about the selection is made. These are technical elements. For me as a photographer can be useful test to use this kind of quality as a tool, but the content of the pictures are just as important.",5,5,Interesting research. Are curious results. Artificial intelligence is especially useful in photography as a support. I continue to rely on my own intelligence.
20,3,1,4,3,9,8,7,8,Model A,I know the reason for the choice made,4,4,
21,5,5,5,4,6,9,9,9,Model 1,Scores are more in line with my expectations.,5,3,
22,4,4,4,3,7,7,5,7,Model A,"A model selected ""my"" beautiful pictures better. Model 1 was more distinctive with regard score.",5,4,
23,3,4,4,4,7,5,6,7,No preference,Allebij enough for me,5,4,
24,5,5,4,4,7,7,8,8,Model A,Substantiated score to see finer,4,4,
25,1,5,4,2,3,9,7,9,Model A,Qualifying goes I feel over the quality of assessment. Transparent> Black box,5,5,Nice demo!
26,3,5,4,3,8,6,9,9,Model 1,"The scores seem pretty random when you play with on and off of the rating criteria. It gives the user the feeling that there is a (significant) other score is endowed as you sit at the controls. The first model is more user friendly. It is useful if, eg in the institutions would have an overview of how the AI ​​conducted the review. Also a selector between ""auto rate"" and manual would be useful, but not feed photographs or a photograph. Remember that too much work is where users will use.",5,5,Teunis doing good!
27,4,5,4,4,9,9,7,8,Model A,Natural selection of what is better,4,4,
28,4,5,3,3,3,3,4,4,No preference,,5,5,
29,2,4,3,3,6,6,8,7,Model 1,"Simpler and better ranking. Model A is the complicated, with the self tweaking will I certainly do nothing themselves.",4,4,
30,3,4,2,3,4,6,3,7,Model 1,"Ranking knocked better. But the model does not account for backlighting and illumination errors by backlight. Main (always good) is sharpness, contrast or colors.",2,4,The autocorrect on my phone works fine. He understands it is better.
31,1,5,4,3,9,9,8,8,Model A,Weighting knocks better,4,5,
32,4,5,5,2,1,1,1,4,No preference,"Both models provide only three of the five pictures back and I do not understand. Furthermore, I do not know why I want to use",3,3,The last two questions are impossible for me to answer on a scale of 1 to 5
33,3,5,5,5,7,6,7,5,Model 1,,2,5,
34,3,4,3,1,7,8,2,8,Model A,I like to see the support of the score and the result is closer to my own preferences.,4,4,Interesting app
35,5,5,5,3,6,9,7,9,Model 1,Blurry pictures are not necessarily poorer quality. The pictures of airplanes I made blurry express path blur. This is a creative choice.,5,5,Detects the system also that most of the photos are photoshopped and run the various objects in the pictures in sharpness set unrealistic?
36,3,4,5,3,8,7,8,8,No preference,,5,4,
37,3,3,5,4,8,8,6,9,Model A,Provides better reflect how I would choose.,5,5,
38,2,5,3,3,8,8,8,8,No preference,Similar user experience,5,5,Nice design of survey. Good luck.
39,4,5,4,3,9,7,7,7,Model A,most sharply,5,5,
40,5,5,4,3,9,9,8,8,No preference,The difference should I see them side by side,5,5,I do not understand what's happening here.
